# 🛠️ GraphQL Issue Tracker Tutorial

Welcome to the GraphQL Issue Tracker Tutorial repository!
This repo is designed as a step-by-step learning project where you’ll build a simple Issue Tracker application using GraphQL and React.

The goal is to:

- Learn how to design and implement a GraphQL API (Apollo Server).
- Connect the backend with a React frontend (Apollo Client).
- Understand the differences between GraphQL vs REST through practical examples.
- Showcase GraphQL concepts like queries, mutations, and subscriptions in action.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Issue Tracker app allows you to:

- Create issues (title, description, status).
- Fetch and display issues.
- Update or close issues.
- Subscribe to real-time updates when issues change.

This tutorial is structured for beginners to intermediate developers who want to gain practical hands-on experience with GraphQL.
